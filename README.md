# Tasks App with Java + Kotlin

This project demonstrates how to utilize Java and Kotlin interoperability.

## Tech Stack

* Languages: Java & Kotlin

* Networking: Retrofit

* Database: Room Persistence Library

* Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

## Features

* Add and edit tasks.

* Offline support with Room database.

* Fetch and sync tasks from a remote API using Retrofit.

* MVVM architecture for clean code separation and maintainability.

## Notes

* I built the app based on my understanding of the test.

* I created two activities (Kotlin version and Java version). I commented out the Kotlin version in the manifest, but it is available if you would like to test the app using the Kotlin activity.

* I was unsure whether to use Dependency Injection (Dagger, Hilt, etc.), but I decided against it since it was not mentioned in the test, although it is highly recommended to use DI.


## Setup

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
